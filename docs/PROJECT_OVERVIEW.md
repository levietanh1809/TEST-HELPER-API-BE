# 📋 Test Helper API - Project Overview

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview
- **Framework**: NestJS (Node.js/TypeScript)
- **Project Type**: Backend API service for test automation
- **Purpose**: Helper application for automated testing workflows

## 🎯 Current Focus: Figma Integration

### Problem Solved
Developed automated image extraction from Figma designs with intelligent component processing:

1. **Basic Image Extraction**: Extract images from Figma components via API
2. **Dimension Enhancement**: Added width/height information to extracted images
3. **Smart Recursive Processing**: Automatically break down large components (>500px) into smaller children components

## 📈 Development Progress

### Phase 1: Basic Figma Integration ✅
- Set up Figma API integration
- Created DTOs for image data
- Implemented basic image extraction

### Phase 2: Enhanced Data Structure ✅  
- Added width/height to FigmaImageDto
- Enhanced API responses with dimensions
- Improved logging and error handling

### Phase 3: Intelligent Recursive Processing ✅
- **Key Innovation**: Auto-decomposition of large components
- **Logic**: If component > 500px → extract children recursively
- **Benefit**: Get more granular, usable image assets

## 🔧 Technical Stack

### Core Dependencies
- NestJS framework
- Axios for HTTP requests
- TypeScript with strict typing
- Class-validator for DTO validation

### External Integrations
- **Figma API**: Design asset extraction
- **Google Sheets**: Data source integration (existing)

## 📁 Key Files Modified

### Service Layer
- `src/images/services/figma.service.ts` - Core Figma integration logic
- `src/images/services/images.service.ts` - Main images orchestration
- `src/images/services/google-sheets.service.ts` - Data source integration

### Data Transfer Objects
- `src/images/dto/figma-image.dto.ts` - API contracts and validation

### Documentation
- `figma_response.md` - Sample Figma API response structure

## 🎯 Next Steps & Roadmap

### Immediate Priorities
1. Testing the recursive logic with real Figma files
2. Performance optimization for large component trees
3. Error handling for edge cases

### Future Enhancements
1. Configurable size thresholds (currently hardcoded 500px)
2. Component filtering by type (TEXT, VECTOR, etc.)
3. Batch processing optimization
4. Caching mechanisms for frequently accessed components

## 🔄 Workflow Integration
This API serves as a backend for test automation workflows, extracting and processing visual assets from design files to support automated testing scenarios.
