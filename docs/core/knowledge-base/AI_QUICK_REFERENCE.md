# ü§ñ AI Quick Reference - Daily Usage Guide

> **Print this document and keep it handy!** | Essential for 75-90% efficiency gains

## üåÖ Daily Startup Routine (2 minutes)

```bash
# Step 1: Context Loading (30 seconds)
"AI, load Memory Bank context from PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md for today's work"

# Step 2: Task Planning (90 seconds)  
"AI, based on Memory Bank patterns, recommend approach for [today's task]"

# Result: AI has full project context and provides informed guidance
```

## üîß Development Workflows

### Before Writing Any Code
```bash
# Context Loading
"AI, load Memory Bank implementation patterns for [feature type]"

# Get Specific Guidance
"AI, review TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md and suggest approach for [specific task]"

# Code Validation
"AI, check this code against Memory Bank standards and optimize"
```

### Problem Solving (2-minute resolution)
```bash
# Emergency Fix
"AI, check TROUBLESHOOTING.md for [specific issue] and provide solution"

# If No Solution Found
"AI, analyze this issue and suggest where to document the solution"
```

## üéØ Role-Specific Commands

### üë®‚Äçüíª **Developers**
```bash
# Feature Development
"Load Figma integration patterns from Memory Bank"
"Review AI model cost guidelines and suggest optimal model"  
"Check implementation patterns for [component type]"

# Test Case Generation
"Generate granular test cases with specific measurements"
"Use configurable language for test case content (English, Vietnamese, etc.)"
"Support GPT-5 model for higher quality generation when needed"
"Focus on individual actions rather than comprehensive flows"

# Test Case Export
"Export test cases to markdown or Excel with parent-child row format"
"Use parent rows for test case info (no expected result) and child rows for steps"
"Format steps as 'Step X: action' in procedure column"
"Ensure clean content without figmaId references in descriptions"
"Excel export fills template sheet 'Test Cases' from row 17, preserves styles and merges"

# Code Quality
"Validate against Memory Bank coding standards"
"Suggest improvements based on documented patterns"
"Check for consistency with project architecture"
```

### üèóÔ∏è **Architects**
```bash
# System Design
"Load Memory Bank system architecture context"
"Review cost implications using AI models configuration"
"Analyze approach against documented methodology"

# Decision Support
"Compare with Memory Bank architecture decisions"
"Suggest approach based on documented patterns"
"Evaluate technical trade-offs using project context"
```

### üß™ **QA Engineers**
```bash
# Testing Strategy
"Load Memory Bank API documentation for comprehensive testing"
"Check troubleshooting docs for known issues to test"
"Generate test cases using documented patterns"

# Issue Investigation
"Review Memory Bank for similar issues and solutions"
"Check implementation guides for potential problem areas"
```

## üöÄ Advanced AI Techniques

### Multi-Document Context Loading
```bash
"Load context from PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md, TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md, and AI_MODELS_OPTIMIZATION.md to solve [complex problem]"
```

### Progressive Learning
```bash
"Based on Memory Bank patterns, learn from this implementation and suggest improvements"
```

### Knowledge Updates
```bash
"Help me document this new pattern in the appropriate Memory Bank section"
```

## üìä Production AI Models

### Model Selection Guide
```typescript
// Default for all operations (95% cost savings)
GPT_5_MINI: {
  cost: "$0.25 input / $2.00 output per 1M tokens",
  limit: "200K TPM, 500 RPM, 2M TPD",
  use: "General development, code generation, problem solving"
}

// Premium for complex reasoning only
O4_MINI: {
  cost: "$1.10 input / $4.40 output per 1M tokens", 
  limit: "200K TPM, 500 RPM, 2M TPD",
  use: "Complex architecture decisions, advanced problem solving"
}
```

### Cost-Effective Usage
```bash
# Always specify model in requests
"Use gpt-5-mini for this task to optimize costs"

# Monitor token usage
"Summarize this in minimal tokens while preserving key information"
```

## ‚ö° Quick Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & AI Solutions
