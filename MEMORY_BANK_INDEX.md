## üéØ Quick Navigation

### üöÄ **START HERE** (New Team Members)
```bash
# ‚è±Ô∏è 15-minute onboarding path:
1. PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md (5 min) - What we're building
2. AI_QUICK_REFERENCE.md (3 min) - Print & keep handy  
3. API_DOCUMENTATION.md (7 min) - Core endpoints
```

### ü§ñ **AI-POWERED DEVELOPMENT** (Daily Use)
```bash
# üí° Golden Rule: Always prime AI with Memory Bank context first!

# üåÖ Morning Startup (2 minutes)
"AI, load PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md and today's development context"

# üîß Before Coding
"AI, load relevant patterns from TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md for [feature]"

# üö® Problem Solving  
"AI, check TROUBLESHOOTING.md for [issue] and suggest solution"
```
